# OpenAI API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Google Drive Storage Configuration (Optional)
# Get your Client ID from: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
# 1. Create a new project in Google Cloud Console
# 2. Enable the Google Drive API
# 3. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Web application)
# 4. Add your domain to authorized JavaScript origins
# 5. Copy the Client ID here
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace placeholder values with your actual keys
# 3. Never commit .env to git (it's in .gitignore)
# 4. For Vercel deployment, add these as environment variables in project settings
#
# Note: The app works without these keys:
# - Without VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY: AI features use fallback logic
# - Without VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: Google Drive storage is disabled (localStorage still works)
