# OpenAI API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace 'your-api-key-here' with your actual OpenAI API key
# 3. Never commit .env to git (it's in .gitignore)
# 4. For Vercel deployment, add this as an environment variable in project settings
