# Pages

Main app pages/views that compose multiple components together.

## What Goes Here

- **Full page views** - Dashboard, Budget, Transactions, Settings
- **Page-level state management** - Data fetching, state coordination
- **Layout composition** - Combining multiple components into pages

## Examples

- `Dashboard.jsx` - Main overview page
- `Transactions.jsx` - Full transaction history page
- `Budget.jsx` - Budget planning and tracking page
- `Insights.jsx` - AI insights and recommendations page
- `Settings.jsx` - App settings and preferences

## Guidelines

- Pages orchestrate components
- Handle data fetching and state
- Manage page-level logic
- Keep business logic here, not in components
